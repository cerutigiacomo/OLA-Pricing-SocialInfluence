Notes:
In every web page we have a single product displayed with the price.

options:
    add x units ofthe product to the cart.
    show 2 secondary products without price in two slots (vertically)
        the second product have more importance
    open a new page when clicking on secondary product were the clicked product is the new primary one.

    Buy the item on the cart.

    
Requirements:
    Buy at least two products. (?)


----

options:
    she/he buys a number of units of the primary product if the price of a single unit is under the user’ reservation price; in other words, the users’ reservation price is not over the cumulative price of the multiple units, but only over the single unit;
    
    once the primary product has been bought, the user clicks on a secondary product with a probability depending on the primary product except when the secondary product has been already displayed as primary in the past, in this case the click probability is zero (thus, in practice, excluding the case in which a product is displayed as primary more than once --- as a result the number of webpages visited by the user is finite);

    when observing the secondary products, the user initially observes the first slot and, after having observed that slot, observes the second slot. Assume that the probability with which the first slot is observed is 1, while the probability with which the second slot is observed is lambda < 1. The value of lambda is assumed to be known in all the three project proposals.

    Notice that the probability of a click on a secondary product depends on:
        ● the purchase probability of the primary product,
        ● the probability to observe the slot in which the secondary product is displayed, and the click probability of the secondary product conditioned to the purchase of the primary.

        ● the clicks on the secondary products are independent of each other and the user can click on multiple secondary products, so as to activate multiple parallel paths over the graph depicted above;

        ● the number of items a user will buy is a random variable independent of any other variable; that is, the user decides first whether to buy or not the products and, subsequently, in the case of a purchase, the number of units to buy;

        ● the actions performed by the users are perfectly observable by the ecommerce website.

    
In the following project proposals, we ask you to develop two different settings differing for the graph weights. First, assume that the graph is fully connected and therefore all the edges have strictly positive probabilities (in practice the secondary products displayed are just two and thus many of the edges are useless). In the second, assume that the graph is not fully connected and therefore some edges have zero probability

The behavior of the user in the graph is similar to that of the social influence. Thus, in the following project proposals, you need to resort to social influence techniques to evaluate the probabilities with which the user reaches the webpage with some specific primary product.





PRICING

2 binary features that define 3 different user classes.
The users’ classes differ for
    the demand curves of the 5 products,
    number of daily users, 
    𝛼 ratios, 
    number of products sold, 
    graph probabilities.
You need to provide three different distributions, each one corresponding to a different users’ class.
